> 1. Runs the simulation. Make sure you enter a number of months you want simulated into the text box before clicking `Run Simulation`. 
> 2. Takes you back to see the results from the previous month. 
> 3. Takes you forward to see the results of the next month.
> 4. Takes you to the end of the simulation, showing the results for the very last month inputted into the text box. 
> 5. Exports the output from the current simulation to a CSV file (which can be opened in Microsoft Excel). The location for this Excel file will be the same place GUI.exe is located, and a pop-up box will allow you to choose the name for the .csv file. When naming the file, make sure you do not overwrite an already existing file. 
> 6. Ticking this box resets the simulation, and changes the button `Run Simulation` to `Simulate Next Month`. Clicking `Simulate Next Month` will extend the current simulation by a month. However, the only other button which will work when this box gets ticked is `Export to csv`.
